## About me 👋

Hi, I'm Yirade, I'm currently a student at Stefan cel Mare University in Suceava.
I am a great lover of technology, programming, modding and game development. At the moment I am still in the beginning, but I hope I can one day become a real programmer, but until then take care of yourself!
